YES! Finally! The Aptible team and I are very happy to announce our public launch.

Frank and I started Aptible because we saw how difficult it was for technology companies to navigate the regulatory environment in healthcare. We believe that many of the most intractable problems in healthcare can be addressed with great technology, and we are working to empower smart, dedicated people to tackle them.

For the last few months, we have been working closely with a group of companies that represent the future of digital health. We are looking forward to telling you their stories in the coming weeks.
<br />
<br />
<br />
We are also excited to announce our relationships with three fantastic organizations:

<br />
Aptible is proud to be part of Y Combinator's S14 batch. All of the partners have been amazing - YC is one of those rare organizations that is every bit as great on the inside as you hope it would be from the outside. Thanks especially to Justin, Garry, Kat, Jon, and Aaron for helping us prepare for this launch.
<br />

We are also part of the seventh Rock Health class. Rock Health is the premier advocate for digital health. Their entire team has been wonderful and made it a joy to come to the office every day. We are particularly grateful to Mollie, Halle, and Malay for their help so far.
<br />
<br />

Cooper is the top user experience design firm in the country. Through a partnership with Rock Health, they are helping us turn some incredibly complex regulatory and technical applications into beautiful, usable, intuitive tools that delight our customers. Lauren Ruiz and Doug LeMoine have been especially generous with their time, and we thank them!
<br />
<br />
<br />
Today is the beginning of something very special. With an incredible team and the support of our customers and partners, we are going to rapidly accelerate the adoption of technology in healthcare, and help a lot of people on the way.
