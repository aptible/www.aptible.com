(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, testimony at the hearing must be given orally by witnesses under oath or affirmation.

(b) At the discretion of the ALJ, testimony of witnesses other than the testimony of expert witnesses may be admitted in the form of a written statement. The ALJ may, at his or her discretion, admit prior sworn testimony of experts that has been subject to adverse examination, such as a deposition or trial testimony. Any such written statement must be provided to the other party, along with the last known address of the witness, in a manner that allows sufficient time for the other party to subpoena the witness for cross- examination at the hearing. Prior written statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearing must be exchanged as provided in [§ 160.518](/hipaa/regulations/160-518-exchange-witness-lists-exhibits/).

&#40;c) The ALJ must exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to:

> (1) Make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth;

> (2) Avoid repetition or needless consumption of time; and

> (3) Protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.

(d) The ALJ must permit the parties to conduct cross-examination of witnesses as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.

(e) The ALJ may order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses, except that the ALJ may not order to be excluded--

> (1) A party who is a natural person;

> (2) In the case of a party that is not a natural person, the officer or employee of the party appearing for the entity pro se or designated as the party's representative; or

> (3) A natural person whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of its case, including a person engaged in assisting the attorney for the Secretary.
