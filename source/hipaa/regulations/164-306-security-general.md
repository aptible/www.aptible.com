> > (i) The size, complexity, and capabilities of the covered entity or business associate.

> > (ii) The covered entity's or the business associate's technical infrastructure, hardware, and software security capabilities.

> > (iii) The costs of security measures.

> > (iv) The probability and criticality of potential risks to electronic protected health information.

(d) Implementation specifications. In this subpart:

> (1) Implementation specifications are required or addressable.

If an implementation specification is addressable, the word "Addressable" appears in parentheses after the title of the implementation specification.
 
> (2) When a standard adopted in § 164.308, § 164.310, § 164.312, § 164.314, or § 164.316 includes required implementation specifications, a covered entity or business associate must implement the implementation specifications.

> > > (A) Implement the implementation specification if reasonable and appropriate; or

> > > (B) If implementing the implementation specification is not reasonable and appropriate--

> > > > (2) Implement an equivalent alternative measure if reasonable and appropriate.

(e) Maintenance.
