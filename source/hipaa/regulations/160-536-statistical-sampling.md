(a) In meeting the burden of proof set forth in [§ 160.534](/hipaa/regulations/160-534-the-hearing/), the Secretary may introduce the results of a statistical sampling study as evidence of the number of violations under [§ 160.406](/hipaa/regulations/160-406-violations/) of this part, or the factors considered in determining the amount of the civil money penalty under [§ 160.408](/hipaa/regulations/160-408-factors-for-civil-penalty/) of this part. Such statistical sampling study, if based upon an appropriate sampling and computed by valid statistical methods, constitutes prima facie evidence of the number of violations and the existence of factors material to the proposed civil money penalty as described in [§ 160.406](/hipaa/regulations/160-406-violations/) and 160.408.

(b) Once the Secretary has made a prima facie case, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the burden of going forward shifts to the respondent to produce evidence reasonably calculated to rebut the findings of the statistical sampling study. The Secretary will then be given the opportunity to rebut this evidence.
