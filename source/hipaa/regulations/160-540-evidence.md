&#40;c) The ALJ must exclude irrelevant or immaterial evidence.

This evidence is admissible regardless of whether the crimes, wrongs, or acts occurred during the statute of limitations period applicable to the acts or omissions that constitute the basis for liability in the case and regardless of whether they were referenced in the Secretary's notice of proposed determination under [§ 160.420](/hipaa/regulations/160-420-notice-of-proposed-determination/) of this part.

(h) The ALJ must permit the parties to introduce rebuttal witnesses and evidence.
