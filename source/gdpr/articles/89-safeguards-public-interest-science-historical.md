1. Processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, shall be subject to appropriate safeguards, in accordance with this Regulation, for the rights and freedoms of the data subject. Those safeguards shall ensure that technical and organisational measures are in place in particular in order to ensure respect for the principle of data minimisation. Those measures may include pseudonymisation provided that those purposes can be fulfilled in that manner. Where those purposes can be fulfilled by further processing which does not permit or no longer permits the identification of data subjects, those purposes shall be fulfilled in that manner.

2. Where personal data are processed for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, Union or Member State law may provide for derogations from the rights referred to in Articles [15](/gdpr/articles/15-right-of-access/), [16](/gdpr/articles/16-right-to-rectification/), [18](/gdpr/articles/18-right-to-restriction-of-processing/) and [21](/gdpr/articles/21-right-to-object/) subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article in so far as such rights are likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the specific purposes, and such derogations are necessary for the fulfilment of those purposes.

3. Where personal data are processed for archiving purposes in the public interest, Union or Member State law may provide for derogations from the rights referred to in Articles [15](/gdpr/articles/15-right-of-access/), [16](/gdpr/articles/16-right-to-rectification/), [18](/gdpr/articles/18-right-to-restriction-of-processing/), [19](/gdpr/articles/19-notification-obligation/), [20](/gdpr/articles/20-right-to-data-portability/) and [21](/gdpr/articles/21-right-to-object/) subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article in so far as such rights are likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the specific purposes, and such derogations are necessary for the fulfilment of those purposes.

4. Where processing referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 serves at the same time another purpose, the derogations shall apply only to processing for the purposes referred to in those paragraphs.
