Aptible databases are hosted inside a private subnet in the AWS cloud. As a result, they're not accessible from the public internet.

To connect to an Aptible database using a GUI tool, first [install the Aptible CLI](/support/topics/cli/how-to-install-cli). Then, follow the instructions for [connecting to an Aptible database](/support/topics/cli/how-to-connect-to-database-from-outside) on your local machine.

Once you've connected, you can use any GUI tool installed on your local machine by connecting to localhost and whichever port that has been auto-assigned to it.
