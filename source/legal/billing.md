Version 3.1 - August 2017

This policy outlines how Aptible determines fees and charges, and performs billing. 

### Invoices
Aptible prices and invoice amounts are denominated in United States dollars.

#### Base Fee
Your Aptible account has a base fee for each product you use. Some accounts, such as Enclave Development Accounts, have a base fee of $0. If you want to lock in bulk pricing, just ask us for a higher base fee and more included resources.

You may use Enclave resources included in your base fee across any Enclave stack or environment. 

Base fees are always paid in advance.

#### Usage Fees
At the end of each billing period, if you used more resources (container RAM, training seats, etc.) than were included in your account plan, simply pay for what you used. Spot prices are located at https://www.aptible.com/pricing.

#### Invoice Frequency
We invoice once per month, unless we determine your invoice is at risk of non-payment, in which case we may invoice more frequently or require that you pay in advance.

### Late Payments
All invoices are due upon receipt unless otherwise indicated.

Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) determined and compounded daily from the date due until the date paid. You will reimburse any costs or expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by Aptible to collect any amount that is not paid when due. Amounts due from you under may not be withheld or offset by you against amounts due to you for any reason.

### Taxes  
Other than federal and state net income taxes imposed on Aptible by the United States, you are responsible for paying all taxes, duties, and other governmental charges ("taxes"), pursuant to the Aptible Terms of Service. You will pay any additional amounts as are necessary to ensure that the net amounts received by Aptible after all such taxes are paid are equal to the amounts that Aptible would have been entitled to if the taxes did not exist.

### Changes to this Policy
Fees and charges for any new Service or new feature of a Service will be effective when we post updated fees and charges on www.aptible.com, unless we expressly state otherwise in a notice. 

We may change spot pricing by giving you at least 30 days’ advance notice before the beginning of the billing cycle in which such change will take effect. Resources included in the base fee of a purchase order are not subject to a price change for the term of that contract, as you have already agreed to the base fee commitment, and Aptible has committed to providing you the Services at the price specified in your agreement.

### Thank You  
Thank for you being an Aptible customer!
