Version 3.0 - September 2015

This policy outlines how Aptible determines fees and charges for services. It is incorporated by reference into the Aptible Terms of Service.

### Base Fee
Each Aptible account has a base fee. (For Development Accounts, the base fee is $0.) The base fee may include deployment platform resources, as specified in your account agreement. You may use those included resources across any Aptible stack or environment. You pay the base fee monthly, in advance. Discounts are available for prepaid plans.

### Usage Fees
At the end of each month, if you used more resources than are included in your plan, you simply pay for what you use. The spot usage prices are located at https://www.aptible.com/pricing.

### Late Payments
Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) determined and compounded daily from the date due until the date paid. You will reimburse any costs or expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by Aptible to collect any amount that is not paid when due. Amounts due from you under may not be withheld or offset by you against amounts due to you for any reason. All amounts payable under the Aptible Terms of Service are denominated in United States dollars, and you will pay all such amounts in United States dollars.

### Taxes  
Other than federal and state net income taxes imposed on Aptible by the United States, you will bear all taxes, duties, and other governmental charges (collectively, “taxes”) resulting from the Aptible Terms of Service. You will pay any additional taxes as are necessary to ensure that the net amounts received by Aptible after all such taxes are paid are equal to the amounts that Aptible would have been entitled to in accordance with the Aptible Terms of Service as if the taxes did not exist.

### Changes to This Policy
Fees and charges for any new Service or new feature of a Service will be effective when we post updated fees and charges on www.aptible.com unless we expressly state otherwise in a notice. We may increase or add new fees and charges for any existing Services by giving you at least 30 days’ advance notice before the beginning of the billing cycle in which such change will take effect.

### Thank You  
Thank for you being an Aptible customer. We sincerely appreciate your business!
