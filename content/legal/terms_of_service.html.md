###2. Privacy  

####Your privacy
Please read our [Privacy Policy], the terms of which are incorporated into this Agreement. 

####Your users' privacy
Aptible provides tools to help you protect and secure information at the infrastructure and platform levels. You are responsible for protecting the privacy and legal rights of your End Users at the Application level. Your obligations include but are not limited to:

1. Properly configuring your Applications to protect your users' information; 
1. Configuring and enforcing user access policies and permissions across your Applications; and
1. Providing legally adequate privacy notices for your users, and informing them that their information may be available to Aptible and/or our affiliates. 

We provide support and training to help you with these responsibilities. Please see our [support resources](/support), our [Support Policy], and our [training offerings](/training).




###3. Fees and Charges  
#### Payments and pricing  
You incur fees and charges based on your use of the Services. We calculate and bill fees and charges monthly or at the interval indicated in the Aptible [Fees and Pricing Policy]. We may bill you more frequently if we determine that your account is at risk of non-payment. Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of this Agreement for any reason.

We may change our [Fees and Pricing Policy]. In the event we do so, we will give you 30 days notice before the beginning of the billing cycle during which the revised policy will be applied.

Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). Charges are exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for paying all reasonable expenses and attorneys fees we incur collecting late payments. We reserve the right to discontinue the provision of the Services to you for any late payments.

Fees are based on our measurements of your use of the Services. Our determination is final. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). To the fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at our discretion and only in the form of credit for the Services. Nothing in this Agreement obligates Aptible to extend credit to any party.

#### Taxes
You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges and will pay us for the Services without any reduction. In the event that Aptible is obligated to collect or pay taxes, those taxes will be invoiced to you, unless you provide us with a timely and valid tax exemption certificate issued by the appropriate authority for each jurisdiction in which you claim exempt status.

If any deduction or withholding is required by law, you will notify us and will pay us any additional amounts necessary to ensure that the net amount that we receive, after any deduction and withholding, equals the amount we would have received if no deduction or withholding had been required. Additionally, you will provide us with documentation showing that the withheld and deducted amounts have been paid to the relevant taxing authority.
 

 

###4. Suspension, Removal, and Remedial Action
Under some circumstances, you are obligated to suspend or remove an Application and take remedial measures. In addition, we reserve the right to suspend your account, suspend your access or your End Users' access to the Services, and/or suspend or remove an Application (take "Remedial Action"). Our right to take Remedial Action is in addition to our right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.

#### Your obligations
If you become aware that any Application or End User's use of an Application or data violates the [Acceptable Use Policy], you will immediately suspend that Application, remove the applicable data, or suspend access to that End User, whichever may be applicable to remedy the violation. If you fail to remedy the violation on your own, we will make a specific request that you do so. If you do not remedy the violation within the time period specified in our request (in no case later than 24 hours), we may take Remedial Action.  

We reserve the right to take Remedial Action if you are in breach of this Agreement, including if you are delinquent on your payment obligations by more than 15 days.

#### Our obligations
We will always try to resolve Acceptable Use issues within a mutually acceptable timeframe. We reserve the right to take unilateral Remedial Action at any time, however, to enforce our policies and ensure the safety and security of our customers and their users. If we take Remedial Action without prior notice, we will provide the reason to you as soon as is practically possible.

#### Effect of Remedial Action
If we take Remedial Action:

1. You remain responsible for all fees and charges you have incurred through the date of the Remedial Action.
1. You remain responsible for any applicable fees and charges for any Services to which you continue to have access.
1. You remain responsible for applicable data storage fees and charges, and fees and charges for in-process tasks completed after the date of suspension.
1. You will not be entitled to any credits for any period of suspension.
