:body: "We’re proud to announce that you can now deploy apps on Enclave directly from
  a Docker image, bypassing Enclave’s traditional git-based deployment process.\n\nWith
  this feature, you can easily use the same images for deployment on Enclave and test
  / dev via other Docker-based tools such as Docker Compose or Kubernetes. And, if
  you’re already using Docker for your development workflow but haven’t adopted Enclave
  yet, it’s now much easier for you to take the platform for a spin.\n\n## How does
  it work?\n\nDirect docker image deployments on Enclave are done [via the CLI interface][0].
  Here’s an example.\n\nTo deploy Docker’s official \"hello-world\" image to an app
  called “my-hello-world-app” on Enclave, you’d use this command:\n\n    aptible deploy
  --app my-hello-world-app --docker-image hello-world\n\nAnd if your app follows the
  <a href=\"https://12factor.net/config\" target=\"_blank\">\n12-factor configuration
  guidelines</a> and uses the environment for configuration, you can include arbitrary
  environment variables for your app when running `aptible deploy`:\n\n`aptible deploy
  --app my-enclave-app --docker-image quay.io/my-org/my-app \\`\n<br>\n`  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...`\n\n##
  Why use it?\n\nFirst off, if you’re currently using Enclave’s git-based deployment
  workflow, you can continue using that: it’s not going away! That being said, there
  are a few reasons why you might want to look at direct Docker image deploy as an
  alternative.\n\nFirst, you might like more control over your Docker image build
  process. Indeed, when you deploy via git, Enclave follows a fairly opinionated build
  process:\n\n  * The Docker build context is your git repository.\n\n  * Enclave
  injects a [.aptible.env file][2] in your repository for you to access environment
  variables.\n\n  * Enclave uses the Dockerfile from the root of your git repository.\n\nThis
  works just fine for a majority of apps, but if that’s not your case, use direct
  Docker image deploy for complete control over your build process, and make adjustments
  as needed. For example, you could inject private dependencies in your build context,
  leverage Docker build arguments, or use a different Dockerfile.\n\nOther reasons
  for using this feature include:\n\n  * You’re already building Docker images to
  use with other tools. Use this direct Docker image deploy feature to unify your
  deployments around a single build.\n\n  * You’re using a public Docker image that’s
  available on the Docker hub. Use direct Docker image deploy so you don’t have to
  rebuild it from scratch.\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about this new feature,
  [head for the documentation][3]! And, as usual, let us know if you have any feedback.\n\nNote:
  Astute readers will note that [you’ve been able to deploy apps on Enclave directly
  from a Docker image for some time][4], but we did rework the feature to make it
  much easier to use. Specifically, here’s what changed:\n\n  * Procfiles and git
  repositories are now optional: Enclave will use your Docker image’s CMD if you don’t
  have a Procfile.\n\n  * You no longer need to run `aptible config:set` followed
  by `aptible rebuild` to deploy. Instead, you can do everything in one operation
  with `aptible deploy`.\n\n  [0]: https://www.aptible.com/support/toolbelt/\n  [2]:
